# CPE212-Project5

PLAN
Create a Berserker class with corresponding .cpp and .hpp. Include constructor and common class functions such as OutputStatus, WeaponAttack, UseAction. 
WeaponAttack is a flat 4 damage. 
Skill 1 "Ambitious Strike": deals increased damage based on targets health threshold(target.CurrentHP) 50/100/150, GetStrength() * 1/2/3
Skill 2 "Frenzy": deals two strikes at target for GetStrength() * .75 each

Remaining is add an entity to database with the class and input file utilizing it.
